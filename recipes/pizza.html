    <h2>Ammama's Favorite Pizza</h2>
    <p><em>By</em> <strong>Brnda Ayer</strong></p>

    <blockquote cite="https://food52.com/recipes/76940-ammama-s-favorite-pizza">
      My grandmother, known as Ammama to family and loved ones, has always been
      my culinary spirit guide. Among other things, Ammama taught me to cook,
      and the love and care she pours into the meals she makes has inspired me
      to do the same. This pizza is a recipe I made when visiting her in
      Singapore last year, largely born from improvisation: I used my favorite
      on-the-fly pizza dough recipe, Bobby Flay's from foodnetwork.com, whatever
      vegetables she had in her crisper, and store-bought tomato sauce and
      cheese that I brought with me from the US. Feel free to use any pre-cooked
      vegetables or protein you have kicking around—this is the ultimate
      "leftovers" kind of recipe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><em>Pizza Crust</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>3 1/2 cup</strong> all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
      </li>
      <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> granulated sugar</li>
      <li><strong>1 packet</strong> instant dry yeast</li>
      <li><strong>2 teaspoon</strong> kosher salt</li>
      <li><strong>1 1/2 cup</strong> water, 110° F</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2 tablespoon</strong> extra-virgin olive oil, plus 2 teaspoons
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Toppings</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1</strong> (14-oz) bottle of your favorite pizza sauce</li>
      <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> eggplant, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> small red onion, sliced thinly into rounds</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1</strong> green bell pepper, seeded and sliced into ¼-inch
        strips
      </li>
      <li><strong>3</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li><strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> red chile flakes</li>
      <li>
        <strong>4 ounce</strong> white button mushrooms, sliced (if fresh aren't
        available, feel free to use a 4-ounce can of sliced button mushrooms)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2 cup</strong> part-skim low-moisture mozzarella cheese,
        shredded
      </li>
      <li><strong>½ cup</strong> basil and cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the flour, sugar, yeast and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand
        mixer and combine. While the mixer is running, add the water and 2
        tablespoons of the oil and beat until the dough forms into a ball. If
        the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until
        the dough comes together in a solid ball. If the dough is too dry, add
        additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Scrape the dough onto a
        lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth, firm ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, add the
        dough, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in a warm area to let
        it double in size, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the dough is rising, mince the garlic, and slice the red onions,
        eggplant,and green bell pepper. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the
        extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat and add the onions, sautéing
        until transluscent. Add the minced garlic, red pepper flakes, eggplant
        rounds, and continue to cook until the eggplant is soft, about 10
        minutes. Add in the green bell pepper slices about 5 minutes after
        adding the eggplant, cooking until tender but still a little crunchy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, punch it down
        slightly, and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Cover each with a clean
        kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the dough is resting, heat the oven to 400°F (205°C) and prepare a
        sheet pan or pizza stone with a little flour or cornmeal, to prevent the
        dough from sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the dough has rested, flour a work surface, and stretch out the
        dough with a rolling pin and your hands into two round pizza shapes,
        about 14 inches in diameter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the dough with a thin layer of pizza sauce, and top with the
        cooked topping mixture, sliced mushrooms, and shredded cheese. Bake in
        preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Let baked
        pizza cool for 5 minutes before topping with chopped herbs, a drizzle of
        olive oil, and serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
