      For a dish to land on Briana Riddock's weeknight dinner all-stars list,
      there are two key elements it must have: It must be low maintenance (read:
      dirty very few dishes) and filled with flavor (but not necessarily a ton
      of ingredients). This one-skillet chicken with tomato turmeric rice hits
      both of those marks with ease. It’s loaded with snappy pantry staples—like
      chopped tomatoes, double-concentrated tomato paste, and a medley of
      spices—that work together like a dream.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>2 pound </strong> bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6
        thighs)
      </li>
      <li><strong>4 teaspoon </strong> kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> ground coriander</li>
      <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> ground cumin</li>
      <li><strong>1 teaspoon </strong> smoked paprika</li>
      <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> olive oil</li>
      <li><strong>2 cup</strong> long-grain rice</li>
      <li><strong>4</strong> garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> medium onion, small dice (chopped)</li>
      <li><strong>1 1/2 teaspoon</strong> turmeric powder</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1/4 cup</strong> (2 ounces) Pomì Double-Concentrated Tomato
        Paste
      </li>
      <li><strong>2 cup</strong> (16 ounces) Pomì Chopped Tomatoes</li>
      <li><strong>2 cup</strong> chicken stock</li>
      <li><strong>1</strong> bunch cilantro, roughly chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, season chicken thighs with 2 teaspoons salt, freshly
        ground black pepper, ground coriander, ground cumin, and smoked paprika.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large ovenproof skillet (such as a cast-iron skillet or Dutch
        oven), heat olive oil to medium-high heat. Place chicken thighs skin
        side down in the skillet. Sear for 5 minutes or until golden brown, flip
        and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Remove chicken from heat and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium and sauté onions and garlic for 2 minutes. Add the
        long grain rice and turmeric powder to the skillet and gently toast for
        3 minutes, or until slightly translucent. Add the tomato paste, breaking
        up the clumps with the back of a spoon. Add the chopped tomatoes,
        chicken stock, 2 teaspoons salt, and bring to a rolling simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place rested chicken thighs directly over rice and turn off the heat.
        Cover the skillet with aluminum foil or lid and bake for 30 to 35
        minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy. Finish with fresh
        cilantro.
      </li>
    </ol>
