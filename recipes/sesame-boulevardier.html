      Thanksgiving can be a challenging holiday for drinks. Usually you’ve got a
      wide range of guests, plus a menu that tends to skew towards big, meaty
      and fatty flavors that are not always an ideal match for fancy wine or
      food—although I bet my wine nerd friends would beg to differ. When
      planning out a Thanksgiving meal, just about the last thing I want to do
      is spend a few hours meticulously crafting a cocktail that requires a lot
      of time spent away from the table day-of, which is why I love to sandbag
      drinks. The Boulevardier, a cousin of the iconic Negroni, is a great
      example of a drink you can prepare ahead of time, and simply pour whenever
      the mood strikes—you don’t even need to shake or stir. Rather than settle
      for by-the-book Boulevardier, however. I’ve folded in a few
      attention-grabbing augmentations. First is the addition of pineapple
      liqueur, a reference to Rick Martinez’s Turkey Al Pastor, which brightens
      the drink up and adds a touch of sweetness and acidity to cut through the
      heavier flavors on the table. Second is an infusion of black sesame into
      Averna, a Sicilian bitter liqueur (amaro) that stands in for the Campari
      that is usually found in a traditional Boulevardier. (If you’re feeling
      lazy, you can skip the infusion, but you really shouldn’t. It’s a super
      easy blender method that adds a mysterious, savory-earthy character that
      seems to come out of left field, but totally makes sense once you get it
      in the glass.) Make life easy and mix this drink a day or two in advance
      and let it hang out in the fridge until the time is right; I developed
      this drink to serve as a digestif-style palate cleanser between the savory
      and sweet courses of a Thanksgiving (or any) meal.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong></strong>12 ounce (1 1/2 cups) Tennessee whiskey</li>
      <li><strong></strong>8 ounce (1 1/4 cups) Italian sweet vermouth</li>
      <li>
        <strong></strong>4 ounce (1/2 cup) pineapple liqueur (such as Drillaud
        or Gifford)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong></strong>4 ounce (1/2 cup) black sesame-infused Averna amaro
        (recipe below)
      </li>
      <li><strong></strong>6 ounce (1 1/2 cups) filtered water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Black Sesame-Infused Averna Amaro</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoon black sesame seeds</li>
      <li>6 ounce (3/4 cup) Averna amaro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, stirring briefly to combine.
        Transfer mixture to a non-reactive container such as a glass bottle or
        covered pitcher and chill in the refrigerator for at least three hours,
        and up to 24.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, pour about a half cup of the batch into a chilled old
        fashioned glass. Garnish by expressing a lemon peel over the top of the
        drink and then discarding the peel. Peels can also be prepared up to
        eight hours in advance if kept wrapped in a moist towel and in an
        airtight container in the refrigerator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 350°F. Spread 2 tablespoons of black sesame seeds on a
        sheet pan and toast for 8 to 10 minutes, until fragrant. Remove from
        oven and allow to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Combine toasted
        seeds and Averna in a blender and blend on high for 30 to 45 seconds,
        until seeds are pulverized and liquid is milky. Transfer to a container
        and leave in the refrigerator to infuse for 2 hours. After 2 hours
        strain with a very fine-mesh strainer such as a gold coffee filter. This
        infusion will keep in the refrigerator for up to two months.
